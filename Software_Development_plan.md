Statement of purpose and scope:

- describe at a high level what the application will do

The program will assist in calculations for cutting timber components of a roof. Furthermore it will calculate Australian orderable quantities of the timber required and 
print an order list given the layout of the building.

- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it.

Constructing timber roofs invovles a level of mathematics that the standard carpenter or DIY specialist lacks. S\\Furthermore calculating materials will be as 
easy as entering a few easy to access measurements. The program will greatly increase time, efficiency and accuracy for builders, carpenters and other 
tradesmen.

- identify the target audience
*A builder, carpenter or an informed DIY specialist could use the program for calculating materials quantites efficiently. It will drastically decrease the time 
it takes to write a quote. 
A construction worker could use the program to eliminate calculations 

- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

A member of the target audience will be required to obtain a 

Features:

- at least THREE features
- describe each feature
* A list of sizes and bevels for each timber component to be cut for a a Gable or Hip and Valley roof.
* A materials list for the timber required for Australian orderable lengths.
* A layout feature for setting out. This may have different selection options for different scenarios. Same concept.

Needs to have - 

        * use of variables and the concept of variable scope
        * loops and conditional control structures
        * error handling
